            `The exhibit "Romanian Identity, Royalty and Architecture" offers a chronological survey of Romanian architecture from 1870s to 1948 with a focus on the Royalties' contribution to the modernization of the country and creation of a national style. The edifices built during the reign of Carol I present both a young country's desire to become visible internationally and the dynasty founder's ambition to update Romanian architecture to European traditions. It was at the beginning of the 20th century that the capital Bucharest was called "The Little Paris", due to the French influence. After WWI, King Ferdinand and Queen Mary sponsored the implementation of the national style in their effort to put Romania on the map of the world. The exhibit identifies Queen Mary's contribution to Romanian architecture landmarks, including her beloved Balchik Palace. The modern style developed during Carol II and continued by his son Michael round up the exhibit that is authored by three major architecture professors: Augustin Ioan, Marius Marcu Lapadat, and Ionel Stoicescu, in collaboration with CREART, Bucharest. American Romanian Cultural Society is putting on this exhibit in collaboration with the UW Ellison Center for Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies.`
