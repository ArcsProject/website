        "\"The Romanian revolution was for me, my own personal revolution. It brought me – to use Andy Warhol’s expression - my ‘fifteen minutes of fame’ for it catapulted me and Romanian studies at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies of the University of London, into the British public eye. This lecture is based on my experience of the 1989 revolution as a consultant to the BBC at the time, an experience that included visual and audio monitoring of events in Romania in London between 14 December 1989 and 10 January 1990.",

Among them were stations from the USSR, Libya, France, West Germany, Hungary, and Britain. I was thus indirect witness to the meetings convoked on 22 December in the central squares of the cities and major towns of Romania – Bucharest, Timișoara, Pitești, Cluj-Napoca, Oradea, Arad, Bacău, Constanța, Suceava - ostensibly to show support for Ceaușescu, and to filmed events that followed.</p> <p> After arriving in Bucharest on 31 December, I accompanied three teams of BBC reporters and cameramen throughout the city, translating interviews carried out by the team with Ion Iliescu, Silviu Brucan, Ion Caramitru, Mircea Dinescu, and many other significant actors in the aftermath of Ceaușescu’s overthrow. The latter included a one-to-one meeting with General Victor Stanculescu. My reflections are based in part on this direct contact.\" </p><p><b>WHO?</b></p><p>Dennis Deletant is Visiting Ion Rațiu Professor of Romanian Studies in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, Washington DC.

      "description": [ "Ivan Semciuc (played by <a href=\"#florin-piersic-jr\">Florin Piersic Jr.</a>) is a cynical investigative journalist. He is skillfully combining truth and fiction in his reports. Then comes a day when something similar occurs in his own life: at the end of a mission in Kabul, he has a one night stand with Ioana, the translator. The event is seemingly meaningless, but the next day, back to Bucharest, Ivan finds out that Ioana died with her wrists cut. The unshakable routine of his personal life enters a profound revolution, as Ioana is haunting him, more present in her death then she was during life. The film is raising questions about truth, love and the price we decide to pay for them. Winner of The Best Director Warsaw International Film Festival 2018. " ],
