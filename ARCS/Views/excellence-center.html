The Center of Excellence ROMANIAN IN ACTION offers
innovative programs for children and youth of Romanian origin and background. Following
the most recent trends in education, our experiential approaches develop intellectual and
imaginative skills while creating fun, student-driven learning environments tailored to each level
of language competence. Regardless of your child’s knowledge of Romanian, we will use total or
partial immersion language pedagogies and adjust our instructional strategies to her/his particular
learning needs and potential.</p>
            <p>
                Theories by Wittgenstein, Bialystok, and de Bruin show that bilingual education is an essential
                aspect of building and developing beautiful minds, of achieving mental flexibility, exercising
                memory and attention, as well as of developing exceptional cognitive abilities. Numerous articles
                and extensive statistics emphasize the advantages that bilingual students have over their
                monolingual peers.
            </p>
            <p>Our programs ultimately plant the seeds for life success for Romanian heritage students by nurturing
creative enrichment and academic excellence through bilingual and immersion education.</p>

                    The programs designed for the Center of Excellence ROMANIAN IN ACTION use the
                    Romanian language as a catalyst of the process of cognition and the assimilation of Romanian
                    cultural values and traditions. In the context of contemporary American culture, students will
                    have the opportunity to experiment with and relate to the heritage of their parents and
                    grandparents, and to develop relations and friendships with other students with whom they share
                    a common heritage. Creating a sense of belonging to the American Romanian community and
                    contributing to a solid personal identity are among the major objectives of our programs.

                        programs are focused on stimulating creativity, divergent knowledge (the way of navigating
                        several knowledge levels), and the practice of linguistic structures appropriate to the students’
                        age and language competence in simulating real life contexts.

vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, and grammar structures which will become the basis for the

(essay, article, composition) in accordance with their competence and grouping;</li>

                        and converse in Romanian through simulating intellectual, artistic, and technical creativity.

                            The goals of the Puppet Theatre workshop are developing communication skills in Romanian,
                            enriching the vocabulary, developing manual dexterity as a stage prior to writing (cut, glue,
                            paint, draw), and acquiring team-work skills.

                        Building on the innate talent of each Elf and Warrior, creative workshops will use painting,
                        modeling, collage, fables and personal stories to access the inner world of each child in order to
                        develop communication skills in Romanian. Visual representation will give children
                        opportunities to know themselves and to know others, as well as to communicate about
                        themselves and their surrounding reality.

                        <strong>Drama</strong> is a personal growth workshop dedicated to the Giants group. Starting from the classical
                        texts of Romanian literature, the Giants will create own their plots and heroes, and will stage
                        their adaptations, reflecting their own life experience. They will learn to read, write,
                        communicate in Romanian while performing the heroes they created in a public show at the end
                        of the semester.

                        nature, geography, environment, cultural diversity, and human races. The Explorers will get
                        familiar with old and new technologies, the means of transportation that may take them through
                        their journey. Through the workshop activities, students will enrich their vocabulary and develop
                        communication skills. They will produce artifacts depicting each step of their journey around the
                        world and will compile a portfolio with postcards, letters, diary entries, photo-albums, maps, etc.
                        Thus, students will use Romanian in authentic and interactive contexts in which they will engage
                        body language and sensorial activities such as music, dance and, even food.

                        and Explorers groups. It combines history and visual art with role playing and improvisation.
                        The roles are inspired by historical paintings of Romanian classics. Students will retrace the lives
                        of the heroes up to the moment of their pictorial representation. Staging narrative paintings
                        which present events from Romanian culture, the students will learn and practice the art of
                        improvisation, the first step toward fluent and free communication while using complex syntax.
