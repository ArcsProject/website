            <p>Join us on an exploration of the blurred frontiers of reality through Romanian films, celebrating the <b>5th Edition</b> of the <b>Romanian Film Festival in Seattle</b>.</p>
            <p>In tune with the Halloween spirit of the first week in November, take an imaginary  journey to Romania, and its <b>"Uncanny Worlds"</b>. We plan to challenge values and beliefs in relation to the unusual, unfamiliar, ineffable, incomprehensible, unfathomable, inscrutable, or the unclear, inviting you to a visual feast of mesmerizing film features and documentaries. You will find out that Romanian films, more than ever, reflect the uncanny aspects of reality, history, politics, everyday life, as well as spirituality, folklore, and traditions; in a word, the uncanny essence of human nature.</p>
            <p>For this celebratory 5th edition, we are thrilled to share the work of an outstanding guest and artist, <a href="http://daniel-ursache.com/" target="_blank">Daniel Ursache</a>. His exhibition, <b>"Uncanny Figments"</b>, will be hosted by <b>A/NT Gallery</b> throughout November. Opening Night and Launch on <b>November 3rd @ 8:00pm</b>.</p>
