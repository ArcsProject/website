      <div id="about">
        <p><a target='_blank' href='http://www.arcsproject.org'>The American Romanian Cultural Society</a> is a Seattle-based non-profit formed by a group of American and Romanian enthusiastic volunteers with a common love and interest in Romania's cultural, historical, ethnic, and religious diversity. Compared to other, more locally engrained East-European minorities, the American Romanian community has been increasing its numbers only fairly recently in the region, starting with the early 1990's. One of the best ways to offer a glimpse of who we are and where we come from is through the universal language of cinema. In a city with a long and dynamic tradition of film-related events, ARCS is proud to announce the 3rd Romanian Film Festival in the Pacific Northwest: </p>
        <p><b>One Eye Laughing, One Eye Crying: [Be]longing</b></p>
        <p>In tune with our title One Eye Laughing, One Eye Crying we played along with the Romanian taste for dark humor and selected award-winning films that will stir up questions, emotions, and will challenge your sense of [be]longing to a given country, culture, ethnic group or generation. Through a variety of genres (animation, documentary, comedy, drama), we will explore the ways in which we relate to the others and the world. Local and international special guests will present the movies and interact with the audience at the festival gala.<p/>
        <p id='sp-thank'>ARCS thanks its partners, The Romanian Cultural Institute in New York, and The Romanian Government Department for Relations with Romanians Abroad of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for their help and support organizing this event as well as to the numerous local institutions, businesses and private donors who helped us.</p>
