              <p>Winner of the Best Editor at DocuArt Film Festival in Bucharest (Romania) and of the Best Documentary Film Production at Indie Film Festival for independent producers, Oana Giurgiu's debut documentary explores the reality and myths about the massive migration of Romanian Jews to the Holy Land. The story follows 19th century Jewish settlers in Palestine, who abandoned their modern life in Eastern Europe and chose a life of hardship in a hostile land. The documentary reveals the hidden horrors of the Holocaust in Romania and the Romanian communists' secret deals for "trading" the Jewish population to Israel. The historical tale is visually trimmed in the Dada style as a tribute to the pioneers of the movement, Tristan Tzara and Marcel Janco, two Jewish artists of Romanian descent. This film is an absolute must-see for the history it conveys and its innovative avant-garde cinematography.<br>

            <p>Based on real events, <i>Why me?</i> (Berlinale, 2015) tells the tragic story of Cristian (Emilian Oprea), a young idealistic prosecutor who tries to solve a complex case of corruption in present-day Romania. The investigation, however, has political ramifications at an extremely high level, and the young magistrate loses both his trust in justice and the power to act according to its ethical requirements. The price to keep his integrity is too high, indeed.

              <p>Based on a true story that happened in a Romanian village in 1953, the film tells us about a wedding interrupted by the State's announcement of Stalin's death and the declaration of a seven-day international mourning. The father of the bride wants to keep the party going, in spite of all interdictions, and moves the wedding guests inside the house, where he nails wood boards over all windows to block off the noise. Despite their vow of silence, the guests become increasingly loud. In the middle of the party a Soviet tank shows up, and soon after all men are deported. Thirteen years later the groom and the bride are finally reunited.

            <div><b>Happy Funerals</b><span>(Romania, 2013, 1h 51m min, comedy) Directed by Horatiu Malaele</span>
            <p>Three friends, Lionel (a Romanian returned from France where he worked in constructions, played by legendary Horatiu Malaele), Kirill (a Bulgarian smuggler), and Igor (a Russian working illegally as a plumber), all heavy drinkers, meet up at their favorite pub, <i>The Happy Immigrant</i>, to triple away their happiness into vodka. The joint is known to the police for its population of immigrants who have chosen Romania as a land of opportunities, taking the risk of illegality. After a routine police raid that chases away the pub's picturesque clientele, the three friends seek shelter in a gypsy camp. After a gypsy foretells their future, including the exact date of their death and how they will die, a dark and funny series of events follows as they try to escape from the spell of this macabre prediction.<a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwZSr2U-yRw'>&nbsp;View trailer</a>

            <p>Born out of the artist's need and desire to share his favorite poems with his public, in his original interpretation, the show will add new layers of meaning to well-known Romanian texts from Nichita Stanescu, Emil Brumaru, George Toparceanu, Marin Sorescu, Spiridon Popescu or Adrian Paunescu. Alongside poetry, the artist will sprinkle his performance with music, theater and lots of improvisation.We invite you to experience a powerful performance full of subtleties, love, humor, contradictory feelings, hope and laughter. It is a show that, as the artist confesses, "is not only about me, but it's about you, too."
            This performance will be in Romanian.</p>
