          <p class='summary'><b>You're an excellent storyteller. Can you share with us a story you told your friends & family about your visit in Seattle?</b>
            I even wrote a couple of stories in a Romanian magazine about my experience there. I just copy-paste one of them: 
            <em>"I go out in front of a restaurant to have a cigarette. 
            I even find a legally designated spot for smokers, on a bench, 10 feet away from the exit. 
            A homeless guy shows up. He looks like he'd love a smoke. I offer him one, but he turns it down, not interested in this shit: he thought I was puffing a joint. <br>
            - Do you know it's legal to smoke marijuana in Seattle? he asks me.<br>
            - Yeah, but it's not my thing, I answer. <br>
            He wants to know where I'm from. <br>
            -Aaa, Romania? I know everything about Romania, he says. <br>
            - How come? <br>
            - One of my Jamaican buddies has a Romanian friend.<br>
            - What do you know about it?<br>
            - I know about Nikolai Ceaikovski.<br>
            - Which one, the composer or the dictator? I ask. <br>

            Nicolae Ceausescu would have taken much pride from such a confusion."</em><a>Read more</a>

          <p class='full none'>
            <b>How was your overall experience as a special guest at the second edition of the Romanian Film Festival in Seattle last year?</b>
            Frankly speaking, it was a great surprise, much more than I expected. Usually I'm a little bit reluctant when it comes to some of the events organized by Romanian communities from abroad. From my own experience, I can say that they tend to be claustrophobic, showing nostalgia for the country and quite isolated from the local public. Happily, that was definitely not the case. The festival was organized at excellent professional standards, gathering both Romanians and Americans. 
            <b>Can you tell us a few things about your interaction with the Seattle public? </b>
            I guess it's enough saying that, after each screening of Aferim!, after the Q&A inside the theater, tens of people came and talked to me outside, asking more questions about the movie,  about Romania, and about me.
            <b>What is the most surprising or unexpected thing you found out about Seattle and the Pacific Northwest during your stay here?</b>
            Oh, there were a lot of pleasant surprises. The full house at both screenings of "Aferim!” was pretty impressive. Or the 2500 people attending a lecture with Anthony Doerr, hosted at Benaroya Hall downtown Seattle, as part of the SAL program. It is hard to imagine for me such an interest in a writer, not even in my country, nor in Paris or London. 
            <b>You're an excellent storyteller. Can you share with us a story you told your friends & family about your visit in Seattle?</b>
            I even wrote a couple of stories in a Romanian magazine about my experience there. I just copy-paste one of them:

            - The dictator, of course!<br>
            Nicolae Ceuasescu would have taken much pride from such a confusion."</em>
            <b>If you were to place one of your novels or movie scripts in the Pacific Northwest, what would you write about?</b>
            First thought, on the Mount Rainier, although I loved the city of Seattle. I was lucky enough that Dana Cozmei from ARCS drove me there, while being in Seattle. It would be, let's say, the story of a sixty years old guy, who lived all of his life in Seattle, but he never was on the top of the mountain that he could see daily. And he finally decides to go there by himself :)
            <b>Do you have any comments or suggestions for the organizers?</b>
            I know this kind of events suppose fighting a lot of difficulties. My suggestion is never lose your enthusiasm. The festival's worth fighting for.<a>Show less</a>

        <h3>Interview with film critic Monica Filimon</h3>
        <div class='intro'>
          <img class='inline' src='images/guests/monica_filimon.jpg'>
          <p class='inline'>Monica Filimon is currently Assistant Professor of English at Kingsborough Community College, CUNY. She holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from Rutgers (2011) and has published articles on French, German and Romanian cinema. Monica is now working on a book about Cristi Puiu's relevance to Romanian and world cinema, entitled <em>Cristi Puiu: Ineffable Experiences of the Profane World</em>.
          We are looking forward to welcoming her in Seattle at our festival for the third time, as a moderator and presenter.</p>

            <b>How was your experience as a special guest at the Romanian Film Festival for two consecutive editions, since 2014?</b>
            I felt great every time. Everybody was very helpful and accommodating, the events were timed and organized flawlessly, and the public was generous and very lively. Even the weather collaborated.
            <b>How would you describe your interaction with the Seattle public?</b>
            I was very much impressed by the number of viewers and, especially, by their love for, and knowledge of, Romanian cinema. It is not always very easy to be on stage - and I usually shy away from such "duties" - but that was never the case in Seattle. I always felt welcomed, and, more importantly, I was very happy that people were very interested in finding out more about each film. Many of the comments and observations were very much on point and uncovered the deeper levels of the films, which, I hope, was as gratifying to the public as it was to me.<a>Read more</a>

            <b>In your work as a film critic, you focus on Romanian New Cinema. Can you tell us a few things about it?</b> 
            The New Romanian Cinema is responsible for putting Romania on the "map” of international filmmaking, and it deserves the full attention and support of the Romanian authorities. It is indisputably rooted in Cristi Puiu's early films, especially The Death of Mr. Lazarescu (2005), which brought Romania its first important prize at the Cannes Film Festival in forty years (it won the Un Certain Regard section). One cannot overestimate Puiu's profound influence on the thematic and stylistic practices of his compatriots. It must be said, however, that the New Romanian Cinema is not a coherent, unified movement; it is not a "wave” with a declared manifesto and strategy. It is, rather, a very lucky "collection,” so to speak, of independent voices and talents, whose one common preoccupation is with the rendering of life as faithfully as possible. There are significant differences in terms of cinema philosophy and approach among the NRC representatives.
            <b>You've been with us since the first edition of the festival, you've watched us grow two years in a row and will be there with us again in November 2016. What is the importance of the Romanian Film Festival in Seattle in your life and work?</b>
            The Festival has been an opportunity to reflect on, and learn more about, a number of films I had not seen in a long time. The chance the public and I had to meet some of the directors and scriptwriters was very precious because their accounts added layers and layers of meaning to the screened narratives. For the past two years, I have been working on a book, and the films screened at the Festival provided a much broader perspective to my topic than I would have had otherwise.
            <b>What are you working on right now?</b>
            I am adding the finishing touches on the book that will be published in winter or early next year by the University of Illinois Press. Entitled <em>Cristi Puiu: Ineffable Experiences of the Profane World</em>, the small volume will be part of the Contemporary Film Directors series edited by Justus Nieland, Jennifer Fay, and Daniel Nasset. My next project focuses on the topic of violence in contemporary European cinema, but it is in its very early stages.
            <b>Do you have any wishes for the Romanian Film Festival in Seattle?</b>
            I hope it will grow every year, and that it will become the most important festival of its kind on the West coast.<a>Show less</a>
