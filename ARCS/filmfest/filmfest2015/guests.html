          <p>Radu Gabrea graduated from the Faculty of Construction and the Theatre and Film Art Institute in Bucharest. His film <i>Too Small for such Great War</i> (1969) participated at the Locarno Festival. <i>Beyond the Sands</i> (1973), forbidden by communist censorship, is considered his most important Romanian film of the 70s by Mira and Antonin Liehm, UCLA Press. Between 1974-1996, Gabrea lived in Germany. His first German film, <i>Jakob, don't be afraid</i> (1981) opened the Jewish Film Festival at the Kennedy Center in the US and was selected at Telluride, Colorado. In New York Times, Vincent Canby discussed his cult film  <i>A Man like Eve</i> (1984) in a very laudatory manner. Returning to Romania in late the 1990s, the director and producer Gabrea made several documentaries, among which <i>Struma</i> (2000),  awarded the Special Mention at the International Festival in Jerusalem, <i>Goldfaden's Heritage</i> (2004), and <i>Rumenye, Rumenye</i> (2006, 2013). He gained his Ph.D. in Film Studies from the Catholic University of Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, with a thesis on Werner Herzog and German medieval mysticism, about which Henri Agel wrote in <i>Positif</i> that "it is one of the most beautiful books on cinema ever written." In 2011 he received the Knight's Cross from the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
