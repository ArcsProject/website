            <b><i>Rumenye! Rumenye!</i>  (Romania, 2006, 58 min, documentary, music). Directed by Radu Gabrea</b>
            <b>Nov 19th, 5:30 PM, at Suzzallo/Allen Library, Allen Auditorium. Free screening with limited seating.</b>
            <section>One of Radu Gabrea's most celebrated documentaries, <i>Rumenye! Rumenye!</i> retraces the inseparable connection between Jewish, Romani (Gypsy) and Romanian culture, through Klezmer music. Lesser-known crossings, such as between Romanian old melancholic tunes (<i>doina</i>) and the so-called Jewish Blues, are artfully brought to our attention by a team of world-renowned experts. Gabrea collaborated with American musicians and ethnomusicologists Yale Strom, Elisabeth Schwartz, Andy Statman, among many others. The director will be present at the screening and Q&A session.

            <div><b>Aferim!</b><span>(Romania/Bulgaria/Czech Republic/France, 2015, 108 min, adventure, comedy, drama) Directed by Radu Jude</span>
            <p>Romania's entry for the Oscars, winner of the Silver Bear in Berlin this year, <i>Aferim!</i>, deals with a controversial topic, hardly ever explored in cinema before. In 19th century Wallachia (Southern Romania nowadays), a policeman named Constantin (Teodor Corban), is looking for a runaway Gypsy slave, Carfin (Toma Cuzin), accused to have slept with his master's wife. Constantin's adventurous search for the outlaw echoes the western genre, while the cruelty towards society's outcasts brings to mind <i>12 Years a Slave</i>. The plot is spiced up by colorful language, humorous situations, great music and costumes. Lovers of New Romanian Cinema will be happy to recognize iconic actors Luminita Gheorghiu (<i>Child's Pose</i>; <i>I'm an Old Communist Hag</i>; <i>The Death of Mr. Lazarescu</i>) and Victor Rebengiuc (<i>The Japanese Dog</i>; <i>Medal of Honor</i>; <i>Tuesday, after Christmas</i>). Filmmaker Radu Jude co-wrote the script with writer Florin Lazarescu who will be present at the Q&A sessions. (O.B.)</p>

                <div><b>Trading Germans</b><span>(Germany/Romania, 2014, 80 min, documentary) Directed by Razvan Georgescu</span>
                <p>"Jews, Germans, and oil are our best export commodities" - such are the terms that Nicolae Ceausescu, Romania's infamous dictator, allegedly used to boast about the regime's secret scheme of human trafficking. Razvan Georgescu's expository documentary focuses on the mass emigration of ethnic Germans from Romania to Western Germany in the 1970s and 1980s. The process was facilitated by a secret deal with the Federal Republic of Germany, in which the latter paid millions of Deutsche Marks to "buy" ethnic Germans' freedom from an oppressive regime. The film gathers testimonies from former officials and numerous emigres in a fascinating, heart-wrenching expose about a little known chapter of human trade in the history of the Cold War. (G.M.)</p>

                <div><b>Crulic, The Path to Beyond</b><span>(Romania/Poland, 2011, 73 min, documentary, animation), Directed by Anca Damian</span>
                <p>In her gripping fictionalized documentary, Anca Damian uses a rich variety of animation techniques to bring to life the true story of a Romanian young man who died on a hunger strike, while wrongfully detained in a Polish prison. Romanian New Wave star, Vlad Ivanov (<i>Child's Pose</i>; <i>Police, Adjective</i>; <i>4 Months</i>, <i>3 Weeks and 2 Days</i>), narrates Claudiu Crulic's voice over from beyond the grave, adding an eerie touch and well-balanced dark humor to the autobiographical reportage. The tragedy of the story is brilliantly lightened up and distilled by hand-drawn animation, soft watercolor palettes, collages of photographs and scanned documents. Anca Damian has received many awards for her feature, among which the Grand Prix for the Best Domestic Film of 2011, from the Romanian Filmmakers Union, and the prestigious Crystal Prize for Beat Feature at Annecy International Animation Film Festival in 2012.

                <div><b>Closer to the Moon</b><span>(Romania/USA/Italy/Poland/France, 2014, 112 min, comedy, drama) Directed by Nae Caranfil</span>
                <p>Legendary Romanian director Nae Caranfil based his latest feature on a real life story, set in Bucharest, 1959. As Romania is looking for new enemies of the State among members of the Jewish intelligentsia, a police officer (Mark Strong), his former lover (Vera Farmiga), together with three other old comrades from the WWII Resistance, manage to rob the National Bank by pretending they were filming a movie. After their arrest, the secret police forces the prisoners to play in a movie reconstituting their crime. This political farce is seized as a last chance to enjoy life's small pleasures. Caranfil's signature dark humor ironically meets Hollywood-style filming techniques, turning a lesser-known page of Romanian history into a universal tale of survival. Caranfil worked ten years on this story before deciding to film it in English, with British and American actors for most leading parts. (O.B.)</p>

              <div><b>Goldfaden's Legacy</b><span>(Romania, 2004, 58 min, documentary, history, music) Directed by Radu Gabrea</span>
              <p>This documentary explores the history of Yiddish theater from its inception in 19th century Iasi (Northern Romania) to 20th century New York, as illustrated by the life of its founder, Avram Goldfaden (1840-1908). A true pioneer spirit, the Jewish Romanian writer established the first Yiddish language theater group with six performers, a song cycle, and a vaudevillian structure. At the time of his death in 1908, Goldfaden had reached such a notoriety that about 70,000 people came to pay their last respects, blocking traffic in Manhattan. Radu Gabrea's brilliant use of archival photos, film clips, recordings and live testimonials documents this fascinating journey back in time, highlighting the close relations between Romanian and Jewish cultures, as well as the impact of the New York Yiddish Theater on popular American forms of entertainment. The director will attend the Q&A session. (M.D.)</p>

            <div><b>Aferim!</b><span>(Romania/Bulgaria/Czech Republic/France, 2015, 108 min, adventure, comedy, drama) Directed by Radu Jude</span>
            <p>Romania's entry for the Oscars, winner of the Silver Bear in Berlin this year, <i>Aferim!</i>, deals with a controversial topic, hardly ever explored in cinema before. In 19th century Wallachia (Southern Romania nowadays), a policeman named Constantin (Teodor Corban), is looking for a runaway Gypsy slave, Carfin (Toma Cuzin), accused to have slept with his master's wife. Constantin's adventurous search for the outlaw echoes the western genre, while the cruelty towards society's outcasts brings to mind <i>12 Years a Slave</i>. The plot is spiced up by colorful language, humorous situations, great music and costumes. Lovers of New Romanian Cinema will be happy to recognize iconic actors Luminita Gheorghiu (<i>Child's Pose</i>; <i>I'm an Old Communist Hag</i>; <i>The Death of Mr. Lazarescu</i>) and Victor Rebengiuc (<i>The Japanese Dog</i>; <i>Medal of Honor</i>; <i>Tuesday, after Christmas</i>). Filmmaker Radu Jude co-wrote the script with writer Florin Lazarescu who will be present at the Q&A sessions. (O.B.)</p>
