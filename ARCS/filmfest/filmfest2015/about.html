      <div id="about">
        <p><a href='http://www.arcsproject.org'>The American Romanian Cultural Society</a> is a Seattle-based non-profit formed by a group of American and Romanian enthusiastic volunteers with a common love and interest in Romania's cultural, historical, ethnic, and religious diversity. Compared to other, more locally engrained East-European minorities, the American Romanian community has been increasing its numbers only fairly recently in the region, starting with the early 1990's. One of the best ways to offer a glimpse of who we are and where we come from is through the universal language of cinema. In a city with a long and dynamic tradition of film-related events, ARCS is proud to announce the 2nd Romanian Film Festival in the Pacific Northwest: </p>
        <p><b>One Eye Laughing, One Eye Crying: Tales of Resistance</b></p>
        <p>The title of the festival highlights a certain Romanian taste for dark humor and wisdom to reconcile life's most demanding contradictions. This year's edition celebrates Romania's cultural, ethnic and religious diversity within a society where personal, unforgettable stories have challenged and altered the course of history. Through our selection of comedy-dramas, documentaries, and animation, you will discover the internationally praised 'New Romanian Cinema' and its precursors. Local and international special guests will present the movies and interact with the audience at the festival gala.<p/>
        <p id='sp-thank'>ARCS thanks its partners, The Romanian Cultural Institute in New York, The Romanian Government Department for Relations with Romanians Abroad of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and King County's organization 4culture, for their help and support organizing this event.</p>
